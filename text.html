<h2> 
The Earth, as you know, is running out of resources,
as water, food, trees, ore, mineral, etc. get more 
scarce. We humans are using too much and not conserving
enough. This means that we are using too much of 
what we need, and not saving enough for the next
generations. Eventually, we will all run out of resources
and we will all starve to death without another
source of vital supplies.
